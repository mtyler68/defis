Passages below that begin with a date are helpful to track any claims I may make about this project before they materialize in order keep track of the currency of this work.

__20JUL2017__ - The xefis project is an effort to create a robust, fully functional EFIS for use in home built, experimental aircraft. This includes the PFD software (this project), the physical EFIS unit itself (Raspberry Pi based), and the additional telemetry producing components (smaller MCUs than the Pi) and network interfaces.
